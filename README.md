# Finger Gun Game

A real-time hand gesture recognition game where you use your finger gun to shoot targets and battle waves of enemies! This project combines OpenCV hand tracking with Pygame to create interactive shooting games controlled by your hand movements.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes:**
  - **Target Practice** - Classic target shooting with score tracking
  - **Arcade Mode** - Battle waves of approaching enemies in a doom-style survival game
- **Real-time hand tracking** using MediaPipe with enhanced gesture detection
- **Multi-mode detection system** that works even when pointing directly at the camera
- **Four unique enemy types** with detailed animations and AI behaviors
- **Dynamic difficulty** with 8 waves across 4 apocalyptic stages
- **Physics-based blood effects** with realistic particle simulation
- **Professional game structure** with multiple screens and settings
- **Camera selection** - switch between multiple cameras
- **Interactive tutorial** showing how to play
- **Visual feedback** showing detection mode and confidence
- **Debug console** for testing (accessible in arcade mode when paused)

## How It Works

Make a finger gun gesture (index finger extended, other fingers curled, thumb up) to aim, then flick your thumb down quickly to shoot. The enhanced shooting system now requires you to lift your thumb between shots for more realistic gunplay.

### Game Modes

#### Target Practice
Classic shooting range experience where targets spawn randomly on screen. Test your accuracy and speed as you shoot down targets before they disappear.

#### Arcade Mode
Face waves of approaching enemies in an apocalyptic survival game:
- **4 Enemy Types:** Zombies, Demons, Skulls, and Giants
- **4 Themed Stages:** Urban Decay, Hellscape, Ghostly Void, and Apocalypse
- **Special Effects:** Dynamic weather, particles, and stage-specific atmospheres
- **Combo System:** Chain kills for bonus points
- **Health System:** Survive enemy attacks and heal between waves

### Detection Modes

The game uses three intelligent detection modes:

- **Standard Mode** (Green crosshair) - Original detection method, works best at angles
- **Depth Mode** (Yellow crosshair) - Activates when pointing directly at camera using 3D coordinates
- **Wrist Angle Mode** (Purple crosshair) - Fallback method using wrist orientation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Run the Game
```bash
python main.py
```

The game will start with a main menu where you can:
- **ARCADE MODE** - Battle waves of enemies in survival mode
- **TARGET PRACTICE** - Classic target shooting game
- **HOW TO PLAY** - View detailed instructions
- **SETTINGS** - Configure camera and other options
- **QUIT** - Exit the game

### Game Controls

**In Menu:**
- Mouse clicks or shoot at buttons with finger gun
- Keyboard shortcuts: 1 for Arcade, 2 for Target Practice

**In Target Practice:**
- **Aim**: Make finger gun gesture and move your hand
- **Shoot**: Flick your thumb down (requires thumb reset between shots)
- **Pause**: Press P or SPACE
- **Reset**: Press R to restart
- **Menu**: Press ESC to return to main menu

**In Arcade Mode:**
- **Aim**: Make finger gun gesture and move your hand
- **Shoot**: Flick your thumb down (requires thumb reset between shots)
- **Pause**: Press P to pause and access debug console
- **Menu**: Press ESC to return to main menu

**Debug Console (Arcade Mode - when paused):**
- Type `/stage [1-4]` - Jump to specific stage
- Type `/wave [1-8]` - Jump to specific wave
- Type `/heal` - Restore full health
- Type `/kill` - Kill all enemies on screen
