# ARCVDE

![ARCVDE Logo](assets/arCVde-3.png)

> **About the name**: "ARCVDE" is a playful pun on "ARCADE" - because this project will host a collection of arcade-style games powered by **CV** (Computer Vision)! üëÄ

A real-time hand gesture recognition game where you use your finger gun to shoot targets and battle waves of enemies! This project combines OpenCV hand tracking with Pygame to create interactive shooting games controlled by your hand movements.

**What is OpenCV?** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library that provides tools for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. In ARCVDE, we use OpenCV with MediaPipe to track your hand movements in real-time, turning your fingers into game controllers!

## Features

- **Four Game Modes:**
  - **Target Practice** - Classic target shooting with score tracking
  - **Doomsday** - Battle waves of approaching enemies in a doom-style survival game
  - **Capybara Hunt** - Save adorable capybaras by popping their balloons in this Duck Hunt-inspired mode
  - **Blinky Bird** - Cyberpunk-themed blink-controlled Flappy Bird clone
- **Real-time hand tracking** using MediaPipe with enhanced gesture detection
- **Multi-mode detection system** that works even when pointing directly at the camera
- **Interactive tutorial** showing how to play
- **Visual feedback** showing detection mode and confidence
- **Debug console** for testing (accessible in Doomsday and Capybara Hunt modes when paused)

## How It Works

Make a finger gun gesture (index finger extended, other fingers curled, thumb up) to aim, then flick your thumb down quickly to shoot. The enhanced shooting system now requires you to lift your thumb between shots for more realistic gunplay.

Future: will have different games with different hand controls.

### Game Modes

#### Target Practice
Classic shooting range experience where targets spawn randomly on screen. Test your accuracy and speed as you shoot down targets before they disappear.

#### Doomsday
Face waves of approaching enemies in an apocalyptic survival game:
- **4 Enemy Types:** Zombies, Demons, Skulls, and Giants
- **4 Themed Stages:** Urban Decay, Hellscape, Ghostly Void, and Apocalypse
- **Special Effects:** Dynamic weather, particles, and stage-specific atmospheres
- **Combo System:** Chain kills for bonus points
- **Health System:** Survive enemy attacks and heal between waves

#### Capybara Hunt
A wholesome twist on Duck Hunt where you save capybaras instead of hunting them:
- **Balloon Rescue Mechanic:** Shoot balloons to safely drop capybaras to the ground
- **Punishment System:** Lose points for accidentally shooting capybaras
- **Progressive Difficulty:** More capybaras spawn as rounds advance
- **Duck Hunt Rules:** 10 targets per round with increasing hit requirements
- **Animated Sprites:** Capybaras walk around happily after being saved

#### Blinky Bird
Navigate through a neon cyberpunk cityscape using only your blinks:
- **Blink-Controlled Gameplay:** Blink to make your chrome cyber-bird flap through obstacles
- **Cyberpunk Cityscape:** Fly through gaps between towering neon skyscrapers
- **Adaptive Blink Detection:** Automatic calibration works with or without glasses
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Skyscraper gaps narrow and move faster as your score increases
- **Stunning Visuals:** Multi-layered cyberpunk city with animated neon lights and particle effects

## Settings & Configuration

### Camera Settings
- Access via Settings menu
- Test different cameras before applying
- Automatic detection of available cameras
- Live preview of selected camera

### Game Configuration
All game constants can be modified in `src/utils/constants.py`:
- Screen resolution
- Target spawn rates
- Hand tracking thresholds
- UI colors and styling

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting for better hand detection
2. **Distance**: Position yourself 2-3 feet from the camera
3. **Hand Position**: For standard mode, hold hand at slight angle to camera
4. **Pointing at Camera**: The enhanced version automatically switches to depth mode
5. **Camera Selection**: Try different cameras in Settings if tracking is poor

## Troubleshooting

**Camera Issues:**
- Try different camera IDs in Settings
- Ensure camera isn't being used by other applications
- Check camera permissions

**Performance Issues:**
- Close other applications using the camera
- Reduce screen resolution in constants.py
- Try different MediaPipe model complexity settings

**Hand Tracking Issues:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Try different detection modes
- Adjust distance from camera
- Check the How To Play tutorial
